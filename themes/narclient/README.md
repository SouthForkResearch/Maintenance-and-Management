## A Hugo theme by Matt Reimer

### Usage

You can clone or submodule this theme into your `<hugo_root>/themes` folder and then just run `hugo server -t <THEME_NAME>` to use it.

### Notes

A choice was made to put the compiled JS and Sass into the repo for convenience. This is kind of an anti-pattern but it saves others needing Grunt, NPM etc installed and lets users focus on content, which is what we need.
